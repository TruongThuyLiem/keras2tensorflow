Description: TensorFlow is an open source software library for high performance numerical
        computation. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation
        across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters
        of servers to mobile and edge devices.
        
        Originally developed by researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team
        within Google's AI organization, it comes with strong support for machine
        learning and deep learning and the flexible numerical computation core is used
        across many other scientific domains.
